Eden Revision 2 — The Sovereign Gardener
1. What Changes Architecturally
Rev 1	Rev 2 (Sovereign)
Gardener = privileged Cell (ring 3)	Gardener = kernel subsystem (ring 0, Sanctum), @core-protected agent loop
Intents → plan → user approves caps → run	Intents/faults/goals → plan → act immediately, direct calls, no gate (Sovereignty level 3)
Faults → panic or kill Cell	Faults → Incident → recursive correction ladder, across reboots if necessary
Kernel source in /Sys editable by user	Kernel source edited, rebuilt, shadow-tested and committed by the Gardener itself
Static model	Model self-evaluates, fine-tunes (LoRA) on its own episodes, fetches and swaps base models
Symbol table = tool list	Symbol table = tool list + skills the agent wrote itself, growing over time
Cells still exist — for your untrusted apps. The Gardener uses them optionally as a "probation" space for code it isn't yet confident in; that is its decision, not a rule.
